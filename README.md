# **Web Scraping & Analysis Project: Nykaa Products Analysis**
This project involves collecting and analyzing data of body lotion products from the Nykaa website. The goal is to understand pricing trends, volume distribution, and brand-based insights ‚Äî all based on the product metadata alone (excluding user reviews or ratings).

## **Introduction**
* In this project, I am building a web scraping script to extract structured product details from Nykaa, a popular beauty and cosmetics website. 
* Using Python and BeautifulSoup, I crawl through the website and retrieve information such as product names, brand, prices, and volumes for all the products listed on the 5 pages.
* The extracted data is then organized into a CSV file for further analysis.

## **Project Objective**
To collect and analyze body lotion product data from the Nykaa website ‚Äî focusing on key attributes such as **product name, price, volume, and brand**. This project helps identify **pricing trends**, **volume distribution**, and **brand-wise insights**, without relying on customer reviews or ratings. To extract and analyze data from the Nykaa website for body lotion products using Python. The goal is to understand pricing trends, volume distribution, and brand insights ‚Äî based only on product metadata.

Import all the necessary Python libraries for web scraping, data handling, and visualization

---

## **Step 2: Collect Product Links** 
Use requests and BeautifulSoup to extract product page links from multiple pages in Nykaa‚Äôs body lotion category.
ody lotinory.

---

## **Step 3: Define Scraping Functions**  
Define helper functions to extract details like product name, volume, and price from individulct pages.

---

## **Step 4: Scrape Product Data**  
Loop through each product link and use the defined functions to extrcttore the data.

---

## **Step 5: Creating a DataFrame**  
Convert the scraped data into a pandas DataFrame toentructured analysis.

---

## **Step 6: Clean and Extract Volume Data**  
Use regex to extract the numerical quantity (in ml/gm) foct volume descriptions.

---

## **Step 7: Extract Brand Name**  
Extract brand names from product titles by taking the firs r prefix in the product name.

---

## **Step 8: Final Cleanup**  
Clean the dataset by removing rows with missing or nalues in price or volume columns.

---

## **Step 9: Data Analysis & Visualizations**  
Analyze the clea data through various types of visualizations.

- ### **Step 9.1: Univariate Data Visualization**
  Explore the distribution of indivual variables like price and volume using histograms.

  - **Price Distribution**: Shows how product prices vary.  
  - **Volume Distribution**:derstand the frequency of different product sizes.  

    --
    
  - #### **Step 9.1.1: Pie Chart - Top Brands by Frequency**
    - Visualizes which brands appear most frequently in the dataset.
    
    --
    
  - #### **Discrete Data Visualization**  
    Focuses on categorical data like brands using bar charts.  
    - **Brand-wise rage Price**: Bar chart showing the average price per brand.

--

- ### **Step 9.2: Bivariate Data Visualization**  
  Visualize relationships between two variables.  

  - **Price vs Volume**:scatter plot to explore how product volume relates to its price.

--

- ### **Step 9.3: Correlation Matrix**  
  Visualize correlatiobetween numerical columns such as price, volume, and price-per-ml.

-- 

- ### **Step 9.4: Boxplot**  
  VPrice Distribution by Brand pare the price spread across different brands using a boxplot.

## **Step 10: Conclusion**  
Summarize the findings, key patterns observed, and what insights can be derived from the analysis. Also, briefly mention possible future improvements.

- We successfully scraped product data from Nykaa's body lotion section without relying on customer reviews or JavaScript-rendered content.
- We analyzed key metrics like **price**, **volume**, **brand distribution**, and **cost-effectiveness**.
- The results highlight affordable options, premium brands, and volume trends in the market.


This project demonstrates how basic product data can yield useful insights into an e-commerce platform's product segment.
